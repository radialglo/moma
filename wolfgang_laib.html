        Wolfgang Laib&apos;s Pollen from Hazelnut will inhabit the Museum&apos;s Donald B. and Catherine C. Marron Atrium, infusing the space with a yellow luminosity. Laib perceives the Marron Atrium as the Museum&apos;s inner sanctum, its womb, and has created this work especially for the site. It will be the artist&apos;s largest pollen installation to date, measuring approximately 18 x 21 feet. The hazelnut pollen that will be used in MoMA&apos;s installation has been collected by Laib from the natural environment around his home and studio, in a small village in southern Germany, since the mid-1990s.
        </p>
        <p>
        Since the mid-1970s, Laib (German, b. 1950) has been producing sculptures and installations marked by a serene presence and a reductive beauty. These works are often made from one or a combination of two materials, accumulated from natural elements&dash;such as milk, marble, pollen, rice, and beeswax&dash;which have been selected for their purity and symbolic associations. Forging a singular path for more than 30 years, Laib amplifies the intrinsic materials and processes found in nature. Laib has stated that &quot;pollen is the potential beginning of the life of the plant. It is as simple, as beautiful, and as complex as this. And of course it has so many meanings. I think everybody who lives knows that pollen is important.&quot;
